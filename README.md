# Chip-8 Simulator

This is a Chip-8 simulator written in C++. The Chip8 is an interpreted programming language that was popular in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The simulator allows you to run Chip8 programs and games on modern systems.

# Features

- Accurate Chip8 emulation: The simulator faithfully emulates the behavior of the Chip8 system, including its CPU, memory, registers, and display.
- Keyboard input: You can use the computer keyboard to provide input to the running Chip8 program.
- Audio emulation: The simulator can emulate the Chip8's sound chip, allowing you to hear the sound effects produced by the running program.

# Nice to have

- Step-by-step execution: You can execute the Chip8 program instruction by instruction, allowing you to observe its behavior in detail.
- Debugging features: The simulator provides debugging features such as breakpoints, memory inspection, and register inspection, making it easier to analyze and debug Chip8 programs.
- Configuration options: You can configure various aspects of the simulator, such as the screen size, the key mappings, and the emulation speed.
